# To Do app in Kanban style
University iOS class project focusing on CoreData integration.

## About the project
As mentioned above, app created for university purposes. It allows basic curd operations on entites. CoreData model consist of 3 entites as it was a minimum number requred fomr us (wink fase) in 1-n relation,As mentioned earlier, the app was developed for university purposes, offering essential CRUD operations on entities. The CoreData model comprises 3 entities in a 1-n relationship, meeting the minimum requirement set for us (wink face).

Upon opening the app, users are presented with the option to either register a new account or log in. Since this project was intended for educational use, none of the inputted data is encrypted or stored in the Keychain. Being one of my initial prototypes for my Engineering Degree, I assumed that any user could generate a new task, delete it, or append comments to it. Tasks, when first created, remain unassigned. Users have the ability to claim tasks, essentially assigning them to themselves. Modifications to the status of a specific task can only be made by the user to whom the task is assigned.
