# To Do app in Kanban style
University iOS class project focusing on CoreData integration.

## About the project
As mentioned above, the app was created for university purposes and facilitates fundamental CRUD operations on entities. CoreData model consists of 3 entities (1-n relations), as it was the minimum number required from us <wink face>.

Upon launching the app, users are presented with the choice to either register a new account or log in. Given that this project was for class purposes, none of the entered data is encrypted or stored in the Keychain. As this project was one of my first prototypes for Engineering Deggre, I assumed that any user could create a new task, delete it, or add comments to it. Tasks, upon creation, are not assigned to anyone initially. Users have the capability to claim tasks, aka assigning them to themselves. Only the user assigned to a specific task can modify its status.
